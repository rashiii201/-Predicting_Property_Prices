# Predicting_Property_Prices :
The objective is to predict the median house value. 

# Overview :
This project builds a model to predict California district house prices using district features like location and amenities. It applies simple linear regression (one feature) and multiple linear regression (several features) to spot key price influencers and boost prediction accuracy

# Deliverables :
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations and summary statistics.
● Data Preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical
variables.
● Modeldevelopment using:
        o Simple Linear Regression
        o Multiple Linear Regression
● Evaluation of the models using relevant metrics (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall,
F1-Score, etc.) where applicable.
● A final, well-documented notebook detailing all steps, insights, and the final model
selection.

# Tools Required :
● Python (with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
● Jupyter Notebook
